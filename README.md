- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cronuside, I'm 19 years old my main coding language is Java.
- 👀 I’m interested in Java and creating interesting projects that increase my knowledge about the language.
- 🌱 I’ve been learning Java for around 6 months now, more recently I've undertook a private project in which I've decided to build a core plugin for my Minecraft server.
